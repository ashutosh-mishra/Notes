To summarize, the key takeaways of below mentioned post are:
Load balancers are a key component in modern distributed systems.
There are two general classes of load balancers: L4 and L7.
Both L4 and L7 load balancers are relevant in modern architectures.
L4 load balancers are moving towards horizontally scalable distributed consistent hashing solutions.
L7 load balancers are being heavily invested in recently due to the proliferation of dynamic microservice architectures.
Global load balancing and a split between the control plane and the data plane is the future of load balancing and where the majority of future innovation and commercial opportunities will be found.
The industry is aggressively moving towards commodity OSS hardware and software for networking solutions. I believe traditional load balancing vendors like F5 will be displaced first by OSS software and cloud vendors. Traditional router/switch vendors such as Arista/Cumulus/etc. I think have a larger runway in on-premise deployments but ultimately will also be displaced by the public cloud vendors and their homegrown physical networks.
